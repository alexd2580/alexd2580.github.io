                <h2>About Me</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-9">
                <p>I am a software developer. Starting with a programmable calculator and very simple procedural programms I made my way through different different languages, paradigms and development environments.</p>
                <p>One of the most interesting parts of software development for me is watching a project grow, as new features are added, while the existing ones are optimized and tuned.
                    Thus the code needs to be well structured and properly documented, so that bugs can be taken care of as fast as possible</p>
                <p>In addition to my professional life I also spend a lot of my free time working on small projects, as well as discussing engineering problems with friends.
                    A lot of them have turned into contests with the goal being <b>efficiency, speed, or code simplicity</b>. For example <b>autonomous agents</b> for games. In general, developing algorithms for
                    solving problems of the current century and challenges of modern, cloud-based and high-scale platforms is a great passion to me</p>
                <p>My preferred development platform is <b>Arch Linux</b>, with its tight cooperation with <b>open source</b> communities.
                    With Linux being one of the most popular server operating systems and also facing the growing cross-platform market, Linux knowledge is an important asset in the software market.</p>
                <p>I consider myself capable of not only operating on and deploying to conventional bare-metal systems but also to container platforms such as <b>Docker</b>. In the past I have configured <b>Continuous Integration</b>
                    as well as <b>Continuous Delivery</b> for multiple customers.</p>
                <p>The study at the <b>TUHH</b> in Hamburg-Harburg has taught me the valuable lesson of never taking anything as granted, especially in the world of software, as well as broad knowledge of computer theory,
                    architectures, distributed systems and communication protocols.</p>
                <p>I am used to working in large teams, which would be unimaginable without version control systems such as <b>Git</b> or <b>SVN</b>.</p>

                <p><b>Other Technologies: </b>OpenCL, OpenGL, Docker, and various system libraries</p>
                <p>I consider myself capable of <b>acquiring new skills fast</b>, which includes programming languages, frameworks, tools, and new paradigms as well.
                    I am also used to teaching and instructing others through working as a tutor for functional programming in Haskell at the university.</p>
                <p>Using the experience of struggling to understand foreign undocumented code, I strive to write clean, and properly documented modules, which should be easily maintainable and extendable.</p>
                <p>I am familiar with different kinds of abstractions, data structures, code modularization, and paralellized execution.</p>
